Methods and useful algorithms for solving kinematics and dynamics problems for serial manipulators.

Incldues:
- General forward kinematics
- General Jacobian calculation
- General inverse dynamics (using Lagrangian or Newton-Euler methods)
- Other useful bits and pieces for representing rotations, coordinate systems and converting between them
